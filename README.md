After updating the paths for the image directory, features, and model, run the command 
"streamlit run fmobile.py" to execute the script fmobile.py which is the streamlit frontend.

# DeepImageSearch
DeepImageSearch is an innovative image retrieval system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of image search processes. Utilizing the power of deep learning, DeepImageSearch transforms the way images are indexed and retrieved by extracting intricate features from images through convolutional layers
